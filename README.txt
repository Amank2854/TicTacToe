First, the program will ask if we want to play 2 players or player vs Computer.
Then it will ask the row and column for insertion, if the inserted value is wrong then it will again ask.
The game will continue until there is no moves are left or a winning combination has been found.
If there are no moves left then the game is declared as tie.
